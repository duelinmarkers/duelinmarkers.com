I've been learning the [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language recently.
You can see [my Rust sandbox on GitHub](https://github.com/duelinmarkers/rust-study).
In addition to the tutorial
[guessing game](https://github.com/duelinmarkers/rust-study/tree/master/guessing_game),
I've implemented
[a decimal number type](https://github.com/duelinmarkers/rust-study/tree/master/decimal)
and the
[Luhn Algorithm for validating credit card numbers](https://github.com/duelinmarkers/rust-study/tree/master/luhn-check).

If you know Rust better than I do (or even if you don't),
I'd love feedback on any of that code.
