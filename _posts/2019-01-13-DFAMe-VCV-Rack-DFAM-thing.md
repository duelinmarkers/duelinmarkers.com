title: DFAMe: VCV Rack DFAM Thing
---
I recently discovered [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) and have been blown away by it (starting with the fact that it runs on Linux).
As a learning exercise I tried to build a [Moog DFAM](https://www.moogmusic.com/products/dfam-drummer-another-mother) equivalent, and it turns out to be pretty playable.
I won't claim it sounds as good or is as playable as a real DFAM, but I think it's pretty complete.

[Here's the patch file](https://gitlab.com/duelinmarkers/dotRack/blob/master/patches/DFAMe.vcv).
It's built entirely out of free plugins.
