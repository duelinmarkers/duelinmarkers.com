title: "My Clojure/West 2015 Presentation: The Life of a Clojure Expression"
---

I intend to eventually produce a written version of this presentation,
but haven't gotten around to it yet. For now, you can watch the video below
and look at [the source on GitHub](https://github.com/duelinmarkers/life-of-a-clojure-expression/).

Audience questions you may not be able to hear:

1. What was your motivation for this talk?
2. Has studying this changed the way you write Clojure code?
3. Has this inspired you to contribute to the Clojure compiler?
4. Has studying this changed the way you write Java code?
