title: "New Tracks and Streaming"

I've now got a micro-mini-album available on all major streaming platforms (and a few I'd never heard of): 
[check out 'Cable Heart'](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/duelinmarkers/cable-heart).
I've also posted a few new tracks to [my SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/duelinmarkers) recently, including one JUST NOW.

Those and more will eventually get rolled into another album that will be streamable everywhere.
