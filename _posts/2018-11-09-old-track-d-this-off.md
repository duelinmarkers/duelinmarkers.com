title: "Old Track: 'D This Off' (c. 2002)"
---

Here's a piece of music I created sometime around 2002. The distorted 808 bass drum is a bit much right from the start. I like some of the string harmonies and the synth parts that come in later. The layering gets too crowded eventually. The portamento (glide) on the heavy synth that comes in at about 2:00 it too slow, and that tone is ... a lot.

I have a handful of other old music things that I'll publish over the coming days.
