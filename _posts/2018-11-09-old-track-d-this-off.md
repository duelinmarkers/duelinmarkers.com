title: Old Track: 'D This Off' (c. 2002)
---

Here's a piece of music I created sometime around 2002. The distorted 808 bass drum is a bit much right from the start, but I like some of the string harmonies and the synth parts that come in later. The layering gets too crowded eventually.

I have a handful of other old music things that I'll publish over the coming days.
