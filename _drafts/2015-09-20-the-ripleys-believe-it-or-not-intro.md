I loved [this show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ripley's_Believe_It_or_Not!_episodes_%281982%E2%80%9386%29)
so much as a kid!
I can't quite say this video gives me goosebumps as soon as the music starts, but it's close.

Although I wouldn't have guessed it from the sound, I'm not surprised to learn that
credit for the theme song belongs to the incredible
[Henry Mancini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mancini).
